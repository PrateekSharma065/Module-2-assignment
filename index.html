<h1> Our Menu</h1>
<div class="p1" id="first">
<h2>Chicken</h2>
<p>First, rub the chicken with a little olive oil (1 teaspoon should do the trick for a pound or so), salt and pepper.
Heat another teaspoon of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, place chicken breasts in and cook until edges are opaque, about 10 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="p1" id="second">
<h3>Beef</h3>
<p>Drizzle the beef with oil and season well with sea salt and black pepper, then rub all over the meat. Place the beef on top of the vegetables. Place the tray in the oven, then turn the heat down immediately to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 and cook for 1 hour for medium beef.</p>
</div>
<div class="p1" id="third">
<h4>Sushi</h4>
<p>Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear, then soak roughly two parts rice to three parts cold water in a saucepan for 30 minutes.
Next, bring the rice to the boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the water and is tender.</p>
